# Audio Coding Decoding
MATLAB app for coding and decoding audio files

I used a butterworth filter with fc = 28 KHz
You load an audio file and save the result. You can also hear the audio whenever you want to HEAR the result.
There are two tabs "Coding" and "Decoding" in the app. After loading the file in each section the function will apply on the file and plots the original and coded/decoded result.
